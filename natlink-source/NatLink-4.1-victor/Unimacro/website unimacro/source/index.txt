Natlink, including Unimacro and Vocola

:ROW:
NatLink is an OpenSource extension module for the speech recognition program Dragon.

The latest test release works for all current Dragon versions.

In each Natlink release also Vocola and Unimacro are included. Other packages, like Dragonfly, need Natlink in order to work with Dragon.

On this website are the instructions for *downloading and configuring Natlink*, and a more detailed description of *Unimacro*. For Vocola see the link(http://vocola.net/default.asp, *Vocola 2 website*).

:ROW:
Work is done on several details before making a stable release at last. For the moment an intermediate release can be downloaded and installed. See below.

:ROW:
Please consider making a link(/aboutunimacro/donation/index.html, donation to Rüdiger Wilke, Mark Lillibridge and Quintijn Hoogenboom), who are closely cooperating in their efforts to keep NatLink/Vocola/Unimacro working with Dragons new releases.

*Unimacro* provides extended and advanced command grammars for *Dragon* NaturallySpeaking.

Unimacro connects to the [NatLink]/[NatPython] project, which again connects to [Dragon NaturallySpeaking].

So Unimacro is an extension of an extension of the speech recognition program Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

Unimacro is free, like NatLink/NatPython, and can be downloaded from SourceForge.

Unimacro also aims at unifying the different open source developments that use Natlink as basis. Therefore on this website
the combined link(/installation/installation.html, installer for NatLink/Unimacro/
Vocola 2) is also presented.

 The Natlink base:
 
-link(http://www.nuance.com, *Dragon*) is the world leading speech recognition program, sold by Nuance.
-*Natlink* (in the past also NatPython) is an open source project written by Joel Gould in 1999.  His general link(http://www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/pythonamacroasystem.htm, *introduction and explanation*) is nearly 20  years old, but still very instructive.
Read for example the general presentation about
link(www.synapseadaptive.com/joel/NatLinkTalk.ppt, *Natlink (basics)*). For a more thorough discussion, read the *link(implementation_and_acceptance_of_natlink.pdf)* written by Joel Gould in about 2001.
 
 The add-on packages:
 
-The *Unimacro* project aims to provide a rich set of *command grammars*, that can be configured by the users without programming knowledge.  These grammars that are presented on this website. 

-link(http://vocola.net/default.asp, *Vocola 2*) is a project that aims for easily making user defined commands. See pages on  link(/features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, *Vocola 2 and Unimacro*), which to use when. Also see link(http://vocola.net/v2/, the Vocola 2 website). Vocola 2 can use link(/features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, Unimacro features). (Note for Windows Speech Recognition use can try Vocola 3.)
:xx:
-link(https://sourceforge.net/projects/voicecode, *VoiceCode*) is the third big application based on NatLink.
:en:
-link(https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly/, *Dragonfly*) is a third package, that has been developed in a more modern pythonic way. It is very powerful, but not supported by the installer on this website. Dragonfly also works with Windows Speech Recognition!
-*User defined grammars* can also be included directly in Natlink.

 What is on this site?

-The link(/installation/installation.html, *installation/configuration section*)
will guide you through the installation details of NatLink/Vocola 2 and Unimacro.
-The link(features/index.html, *features section*) explains the powerful things that are implemented with Unimacro. 
-A comparison between link(features/unimacroandvocola/index.html, *Unimacro and Vocola*), they coexist and cooperate on many aspects.
-The link(/grammars/index.html, *grammars section*) is by far the most important for practical use.  Most of the grammars are designed to be global, so first look into the global grammars examples. 
-More technical details of the different link(features/grammarclasses/index.html, *Unimacro grammar classes*) and link(installation/technicaldetails/index.html, *NatLink in general*).
-Finally, link(aboutunimacro, *About Unimacro*) gives information on the authors of this project and the copyright notice, and asks you for a donation.


 Demo movies
 
Some  demonstration movies have been made, to show features of Unimacro.
